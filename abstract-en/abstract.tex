\icode{lsql-csv} is a tool for small CSV file data querying from a shell with short
  queries. It makes it possible to work with small CSV files like with a read-only
  relational databases. The tool implements a new language LSQL similar to SQL,
  specifically designed for working with CSV files in a shell. 
  LSQL aims to be a more lapidary language than SQL.
  Its design purpose is to enable its user to quickly write simple queries directly
  to the terminal.
