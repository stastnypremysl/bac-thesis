The goal of this thesis was to create a new tool for small CSV file data quering from a shell with short queries.
It ought to be simple, comply to Unix philosophy, and use more lapidary language than SQL.
It ought to enable its user to quickly write simple queries directly to the terminal.

Our new tool \icode{lsql-csv} implements a new language LSQL similar to
SQL, specifically designed for working with CSV files in shell. It makes it possible to work with small CSV files like with a read-only relational databases.

In some of the usecases the tool provides shorter and more readable commands then you would get by using standard Unix tools and the 
language is more lapidary than SQL.

The \icode{lsql-csv} have been uploaded to Hackage public package repository and therefore is easily installable. 
It provides automatic Haddock documentation, which is browseable from there. 
It has been also published on GitHub with \icode{README.md} file containing the full user documentation including the tutorial and grammar description.
