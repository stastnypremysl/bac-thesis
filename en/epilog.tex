The goal of this thesis was to create a new tool for small CSV file data querying from a shell with short queries.
It ought to be simple, comply with Unix philosophy, and use more lapidary language than SQL.
It ought to enable its users to quickly write simple queries directly to the terminal.

Our new tool \icode{lsql-csv} implements a new language LSQL similar to
SQL, specifically designed for working with CSV files in a shell. It makes it possible to work with small CSV files like with a read-only relational database.

In some of the use cases, the tool provides shorter and more readable commands then you would get by using standard Unix tools and the 
language is more lapidary than SQL.

The \icode{lsql-csv} package has been uploaded to the Hackage public package repository and therefore is easily installable. 
It provides automatic Haddock documentation, which is browseable from there. 
It has also been published on GitHub with the \icode{README.md} file containing the full user documentation including the tutorial and grammar description.
